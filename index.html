              Hi all. My name is <a class="my-name">Fernando Gaol</a>
              and I am based in Provo, UT. My story as a developer started when
              I was 13, and I decided to build a first-person shooting game. I
              was able to pull it off by watching tutorials, but I had no idea
              how that code worked. From there on, I tried building more complex
              games, but my abilities were limited. I failed multiple times so I
              decided to learn more in-depth on how to code. However, when I was
              searching for game development courses on the web, I also found
              web development courses. Web development caught my attention the
              most because with Web Development I could see what I was building
              in real-time. I would see the style and the site taking form
              within minutes and that was something that I had not yet
              experienced. From that point on, I started taking some courses on
              <a class="code-academy">Code Academy</a> such as
              <a class="bio-skills">HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</a>. I started
              coding for hours every day so that I could get better at what I
              like to do most.<br /><br />
              Apart from coding, I like to play soccer, volleyball, and play
              games on the computer such as League of Legends, Call of Duty, and
              more. I also like learning new languages and spending time with
              friends and family; even though I spend most of my days on the
              computer.

            GTPro is a project manager app that gives the user the ability to
            keep track of to do lists, projects, vacation plans, and more. I
            developed this app to help me and my co-workers keep track of work
            projects and kanban systems. What are are you going to use it for?
