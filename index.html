              Hi and welcome to my page. My name is
              <a class="my-name">Fernando Gaol</a> and I am based in Provo, UT.
              My story as a developer started when I was 13 and I decided to
              build a game. I was able to pull it off by watching tutorials, but
              I had no idea how that code worked. From there on, I tried
              building more complex games, but my abilities were limited. I
              failed multiple times so I decided to learn more in depth how to
              code. However, when I was searching for game development on the
              web, I also found web development. For some reason, web
              development caught my attention the most so I started taking some
              courses on <a class="code-academy">Code Academy</a> such as
              <a class="bio-skills">HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</a>. I started
              coding for hours every day so that I could get better at what I
              like to do the most. <br /><br />
              Over time, I improved a lot and gained more skills, but I got to a
              point where the courses were no longer helping me learn and I hit
              a plato. That is why I am currently taking a Full Stack Bootcamp
              at
              <a

                target="blanket"
                class="thinkful"
                >Thinkful</a
              >. My goal is make to the best out of it and utilize all the
              resources that I now have available such as mentors, instructors
              and technical support. I strongly believe that with this cohort, I
              will be able to fill in the gap and gain the skills I have not yet
              been able to acquire. <br /><br />
              Apart from coding, I like to play soccer, volleyball, and play
              games on the computer such as League of Legends, Call of Duty, and
              more. I also like learning new languages and spending time with
              friends and family, even though I spend most of my days on the
              computer. Other than that, I am married and I don't have any kids
              yet, but I do plan to have a couple of them after I develop my
              skills as a web developer.

        This project was built to test your knowledge about soccer. There are 5
        questions and no question can be skipped. This app gives feedback about
        whether or not you got the right answer. At the end, it will display the
        final score and it will have how many questions you answered correctly
        out of 5 questions.<br />
