              Hi and welcome to my page. My name is
              <a class="my-name">Fernando Gaol</a> and I am based in Provo, UT.
              My story as a developer started when I was 13 and I decided to
              build a game. I was able to pull it off by watching tutorials, but
              I had no idea how that code worked. From there on, I tried
              building more complex games, but my abilities were limited. I
              failed multiple times so I decided to learn more in depth how to
              code. However, when I was searching for game development on the
              web, I also found web development. For some reason, web
              development caught my attention the most so I started taking some
              courses on <a class="code-academy">Code Academy</a> such as
              <a class="bio-skills">HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</a>. I started
              coding for hours every day so that I could get better at what I
              like to do the most. <br /><br />
              From that point on, I knew that I wanted to code and that it would
              be a very challenging goal to achieve. However, the more I
              challenge myself, the more I learn and accomplish things. I also
              realized that with Web Development I could see what I was building
              in real time. I would see the style and the site taking form
              within minutes and that was something that I had not yet
              experienced because prior to HTML and CSS I was only doing backend
              in C# and C++. . <br /><br />
              Apart from coding, I like to play soccer, volleyball, and play
              games on the computer such as League of Legends, Call of Duty, and
              more. I also like learning new languages and spending time with
              friends and family, even though I spend most of my days on the
              computer. Other than that, I am married and I don't have any kids
              yet.

        This project was built to test your knowledge about soccer. There are 5
        questions and no question can be skipped. This app gives feedback about
